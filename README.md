## Exercises:

1.  [**Array Insertion**](./array_insert.c):

        The steps to solve the problem:

          1 - First get the element to be inserted, say x
          2 - Then get the position at which this element is to be inserted, say pos
          3 - Then shift the array elements from this position to one position forward(towards right), and do this for all the other elements next to pos.
          4 - Insert the element x now at the position pos, as this is now empty.

1.  [**String Reversing**](./strrev.c):

        The steps to solve the problem:

          1 - create an empty stack
          2 - one by one push all characters of string to stack
          3 - one by one pop all characters from stack and put them back to string.
