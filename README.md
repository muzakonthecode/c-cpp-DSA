## Exercises:

1. [**Array Insertion**](./array_insert.c):

        The steps to solve the problem:

          - First get the element to be inserted, say x
          - Then get the position at which this element is to be inserted, say pos
          - Then shift the array elements from this position to one position forward(towards right), and do this for all the other elements next to pos.
          - Insert the element x now at the position pos, as this is now empty.
